# Supabase Integration Refactor Plan

## Overview
This directory contains the comprehensive refactoring plans for our Supabase integration, focusing on improving code organization, type safety, and authentication patterns.

## Documents

### 1. [server-client-refactor.md](./server-client-refactor.md)
- Consolidating Supabase server/client implementations
- Moving from old structure to new `/lib/supabase` structure
- File organization and dependency updates

### 2. [types-organization.md](./types-organization.md)
- Organizing Supabase-related types
- Integration with existing types structure
- Type safety improvements

### 3. [auth-modernization.md](./auth-modernization.md)
- Modernizing authentication patterns
- Migration from Context-based to Layout-based auth
- Middleware improvements

## Execution Order
1. Server/Client Refactor
   - Consolidate implementations
   - Update import paths
   - Verify functionality

2. Types Organization
   - Move types to appropriate locations
   - Update type imports
   - Ensure type safety

3. Auth Modernization
   - Implement new auth patterns
   - Gradually migrate components
   - Remove deprecated implementations

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (Server/Client): 1-2 days
- Phase 2 (Types): 1 day
- Phase 3 (Auth): 2-3 days

## Testing Strategy
Each phase includes:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Manual testing of critical paths
