 * Generated API Schema Types

 * This file contains automatically generated types for API schemas.
 * DO NOT MODIFY this file directly - it should be generated through automation.
 * 
 * These types represent the schema shapes for API requests and responses,
 * and are used in conjunction with database.ts for complete API type safety.
